<strong>Project Goal:</strong>
<br/><br/>
Develop a prototype functional game engine with a focus on core functionalities and utilize it to create a basic, playable game as a solo indie developer.

<br/><br/>
<strong>Key Activities:</strong>
<br/><br/>

As a testament to my expertise in React.js and my commitment to continuous learning, I proudly present my latest projectâ€”a comprehensive, feature-rich e-commerce online store. Crafted from scratch using React.js in the renowned Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor, this project allowed me to put my skills to the test and further expand my knowledge in web development.
<br/><br/>
The primary motivation behind embarking on this ambitious endeavor was to challenge myself and push the boundaries of my React.js skills. By single-handedly developing a full-fledged e-commerce website, I honed my abilities in component-based architecture, state management, and React Router, among other vital concepts.
<br/><br/>
With this project, I successfully created an end-to-end e-commerce solution that includes key features such as product listings, shopping cart functionality, secure payment processing, and user account management. The project showcases my ability to integrate complex systems and deliver a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
<br/><br/>
By featuring my full-fledged e-commerce online store project in my web portfolio, I aim to highlight my proficiency in React.js, as well as my determination to take on challenging projects and continuously expand my skills. It stands as a testament to my passion for web development and my commitment to delivering high-quality, impactful solutions.
<br/><br/>
Explore the project, experience the immersive shopping journey, and witness the culmination of my efforts in creating a remarkable e-commerce online store powered by React.js, CSS, and HTML.

While my peers opted to code the project in Java, I chose to differentiate myself by taking on the challenge of developing the application in C++. The project comprised four distinct stages, each building on the previous one. In the first stage, I designed and built a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) to support the type-free programming language, similar to Python and JavaScript. In the second stage, I developed a parser to effectively parse instructions from the programming language. In the third stage, I implemented an interpreter to accurately interpret the parsed instructions. Finally, in the fourth and final stage, I extended the application to support array allocation and index operations, demonstrating my strong aptitude for complex problem-solving and programming."

Using my prior experience in 3D graphics programming with modern OpenGL, which I had gained on my own before taking the course, I designed and developed the project using the OpenGL Graphics API version 2.1 and programming language C++. The project required the application of the concepts learned throughout the course to create a 2D or 3D scene from scratch. In my project, I created a fully-realized 3D scene featuring a snowman, table, chairs, rotating ceiling fan, and a free-moving 3D camera that allowed users to explore the scene from any angle. Notably, all objects in the scene were manually created, demonstrating my strong aptitude for hands-on design and development." +

The project involved the use of various technical skills, including C++, GLSL, OpenGL API, Data Structures & Algorithms, Vector Mathematics, and OOP. The primary objective was to take a square grid mesh, along with a height map, and use the image data to displace the vertex position height component. I then implemented a quadtree-based LOD algorithm to subdivide the grid mesh into smaller squares based on the viewer's position. This was achieved by including and excluding vertex indices from the grid mesh, creating a dynamic and highly interactive terrain rendering system.
